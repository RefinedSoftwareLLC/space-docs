Let's explore some awesome powers of Space Cloud. In this guide, we will:

- Create tables
- Make trainers and catch Pokemons 😍 (Insert operation)
- Retrieve all trainers along with their Pokemons 😎 (Join operation)

## Create tables

> **Note:** If you are using MongoDB, you can skip this step, since MongoDB is schemaless.

Head over to the `Database` section in `Mission Control`.

Click on `Add table` button to open this form:

![Create a project screen](/images/screenshots/add-table.png)

Give your table name as `trainer`.

**Copy-paste the following schema and hit save:**

{{< highlight graphql >}}
type trainer {
  id: ID! @primary
  name: String!
  pokemons: [pokemon] @link(table: "pokemon", from: "id", to: "trainer_id")
}
{{< /highlight >}}

> **Note:** Don't worry if this syntax is new to you. It is GraphQL SDL which Space Cloud uses to create tables for you. You can read more about it later from [here](/essentials/data-modelling).

Similarly, to create a `pokemon` table, click on `Add Table` button once again.

Give your table name as `pokemon`.

{{< highlight graphql >}}
type pokemon {
  id: ID! @primary
  name: String!
  trainer_id: ID! @foreign(table: "trainer", field: "id")
}
{{< /highlight >}}


## Making trainers and catching pokemons (insert operation)

Let's insert some trainers along with their pokemons.

Head over to the `Explorer` section in `Mission Control`:

![Explorer](/images/screenshots/explorer.png)

Try running the following query in the GraphiQL section:

{{< highlight graphql >}}
mutation {
  insert_trainer(
    docs: [
      { 
        id: "1",
        name: "Ash",
        pokemons: [
          { id: "1", name: "Pikachu" },
          { id: "2", name: "Snorlax" }
        ] 
      },
      { 
        id: "2",
        name: "Misty",
        pokemons: [
          { id: "3", name: "Psyduck" },
          { id: "4", name: "Staryu" }
        ] 
      },      
    ]
  ) @postgres {
    status
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

On successful insert, you should be able to see the `status` as `200` which means you have inserted the records in the database successfully.

## Retrieve trainers along with their Pokemons (join operation) 

Try running the following query in GraphiQL:

{{< highlight graphql >}}
query {
  trainer @postgres {
    id
    name
    pokemons {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The response should look something like this:

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "trainer": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Ash",
      "pokemons": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "name": "Pikachu"
        },
        {
          "id": "2",
          "name": "Snorlax"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "name": "Misty",
      "pokemons": [
        {
          "id": "3",
          "name": "Psyduck"
        },
        {
          "id": "4",
          "name": "Staryu"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
{{< /highlight >}}

## Next Steps

Awesome! We have just started our Pokemon journey _without writing a single line of backend code_. The journey ahead is undoubtedly going to be super exciting!
