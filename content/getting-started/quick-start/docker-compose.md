This guide helps you run a local development setup that sets up both Space Cloud and MongoDB. It lets you explore the Space Cloud APIs on MongoDB without having to set up any frontend projects.

> **Note:** MongoDB is not a dependency of Space Cloud. We are using MongoDB in this guide for ease of use because of its schemaless nature.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) >= 18.02.0
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) >= 1.20.0


## Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

The [spaceuptech/space-cloud/install-manifests](https://github.com/spaceuptech/space-cloud/tree/master/install-manifests) repo contains all installation manifests required to deploy Space Cloud anywhere. Get the docker compose file from there:

{{< highlight bash>}}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spaceuptech/space-cloud/master/install-manifests/quick-start/docker-compose/mongo/docker-compose.yaml
{{< /highlight >}}

## Step 2: Run Space Cloud & MongoDB

{{< highlight bash>}}
docker-compose up -d
{{< /highlight >}}

Check if the containers are running:

{{< highlight bash>}}
docker ps
{{< /highlight >}}

## Step 3: Configure Space Cloud

If you exec into docker container of Space Cloud, you can see a `config.yaml` file generated by Space Cloud in the home directory.

Space Cloud needs this config file to function. The config file is used to load information like the database to be used, its connection string, security rules, etc. 

Space Cloud has it's own Mission Control (admin UI) to configure all of this quickly. 

### Open Mission Control

Head over to `http://localhost:4122/mission-control` to open Mission Control.

> **Note:** Replace `localhost` with the address of your Space Cloud if you are not running it locally. 

### Creating a project

Click on `Create a Project` button to open the following screen:

![Create a project screen](/images/screenshots/create-project.png)

Give a `name` to your project. MongoDB is selected as your database by default. Keep it as it is for this guide.

Hit `Next` to create the project. 

### Configuring DB config

Head over to the `Database` section. 

As you can see, the connection status would be disconnected.

Click on the `Edit Connection` button:

![Edit connection details](/images/screenshots/edit-connection.png)

Copy paste the following connection string in it: 

{{< highlight html >}}
mongodb://mongo:27017
{{< /highlight >}}

That's all that is required to configure Space Cloud for this guide!

## Step4: Let us try it out 

Our backend is up and running, configured to expose APIs on MongoDB. Time to explore its awesome powers.
