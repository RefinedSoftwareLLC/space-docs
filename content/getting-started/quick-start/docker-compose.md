This guide helps you run a local development setup that sets up both Space Cloud and Postgres. It lets you explore the GraphQL APIs of Space Cloud on Postgres without having to set up any frontend projects.

> **Note:** If you want to get started with some other database, then you can follow these getting started guides - [Getting started with MySQL](https://blog.spaceuptech.com/posts/getting-started-with-graphql-and-mysql/) and [Getting started with MongoDB](https://blog.spaceuptech.com/posts/getting-started-with-graphql-and-mongo/).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) >= 18.02.0
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) >= 1.20.0


## Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

The [spaceuptech/space-cloud/install-manifests](https://github.com/spaceuptech/space-cloud/tree/master/install-manifests) repo contains all installation manifests required to deploy Space Cloud anywhere. Get the docker compose file from there:

{{< highlight bash>}}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spaceuptech/space-cloud/master/install-manifests/quick-start/docker-compose/postgres/docker-compose.yaml
{{< /highlight >}}

You should be able to see a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following contents:

{{< highlight yaml >}}
version: '3.6'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
  space-cloud:
    image: spaceuptech/space-cloud
    ports:
    - "4122:4122"
    - "4126:4126"
    depends_on:
    - "postgres"
    restart: always
    environment:
      ## The DEV environment lets you use Mission Control (Admin UI) without login
      ## Change the dev mode to false if you want a login to your Mission Control UI
      DEV: "true"
      ## Uncomment next lines to change the login credentials of Mission Control UI
      # ADMIN_USER: "admin"
      # ADMIN_PASS: "123"
      # ADMIN_SECRET: "some-secret" # This is the JWT secret used for login authentication in Mission Control
{{< /highlight >}}

## Step 2: Run Space Cloud & Postgres

{{< highlight bash>}}
docker-compose up -d
{{< /highlight >}}

Check if the containers are running:

{{< highlight bash>}}
docker ps
{{< /highlight >}}

## Step 3: Configure Space Cloud

If you exec into docker container of Space Cloud, you can see a `config.yaml` file generated by Space Cloud in the home directory.

Space Cloud needs this config file to function. The config file is used to load information like the database to be used, its connection string, security rules, etc. 

Space Cloud has it's own Mission Control (admin UI) to configure all of this quickly. 

### Open Mission Control

Head over to [http://localhost:4122/mission-control](http://localhost:4122/mission-control) to open Mission Control.

> **Note:** Replace `localhost` with the address of your Space Cloud if you are not running it locally. 

### Creating a project

Click on `Create a Project` button to open the following screen:

![Create a project screen](/images/screenshots/create-project.png)

Give a `name` to your project. 

Hit `Create Project` button to create the project. 

### Adding database to your project

After creating the project, the next step is to add a database to your project:

![Add database](/images/screenshots/add-database.png)

Select `POSTGRESQL` as your database.

Copy-paste the following connection string:

{{< highlight html >}}
postgres://postgres:mysecretpassword@postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
{{< /highlight >}}

Hit `Add database` button. That's all that is required to configure Space Cloud for this guide!

## Step4: Let us try it out 

Our backend is up and running, configured to expose APIs on Postgres. Time to explore its awesome powers.
