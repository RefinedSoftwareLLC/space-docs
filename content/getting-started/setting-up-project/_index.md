This section talks in depth about setting up a frontend or backend project to use Space Cloud in your preferred language.

> **Note:** Make sure you have already [deployed](/getting-started/deployment) Space Cloud.

## Available options

Space Cloud supports a wide variety of protocols (GraphQL, HTTP, websockets and gRPC).

### For GraphQL lovers

You can use any GraphQL client out there to talk to Space Cloud. However, it's always recommended to use a popular open source client (eg. Apollo).

Follow this [guide](/getting-started/setting-up-project/graphql) to set up Apollo client (recommended for graphql) in your javascript project.

> **Note:** Before choosing an option, check the [feature coverage](/getting-started/setting-up-project/#feature-coverage) for the various options.

### For REST lovers

If you don't want to use graphql, we have made the following client SDKs for you:

- [Javascript](/getting-started/setting-up-project/javascript) for web and Nodejs projects
- [Golang](/getting-started/setting-up-project/golang) for Golang projects
- [Java](/getting-started/setting-up-project/java) for Android or Java projects (Coming Soon!)

The javascript client uses the HTTP and websocket endpoints under the hood whereas the other clients uses the gRPC endpoints of Space Cloud.

> **Note:** For other languages, you can use our REST APIs directly which are documented [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/YourTechBud/space-cloud/0.11.0).
